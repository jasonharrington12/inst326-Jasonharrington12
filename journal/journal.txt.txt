Week 1
I used ai to help me creating project ideas with claude ai. I asked the ai to create project ideas for our topic which is digital archive management system. It created a couple of different suggestions that I will run by with my group the next time we meet up. Here is the url with the questions I asked https://claude.ai/chat/dd15d296-3660-4cdd-be2c-0c710c0de3bd. 

Week 2
I continued to use ai to help create project idead with claude. I continued to ask ai to create project ideas like last week but gave it key words to try to condense the ideas. I used ai to help me creating project ideas with claude ai. I asked the ai to create project ideas for our topic which is digital archive management system. It created a couple of different suggestions that I will run by with my group the next time we meet up.

I also used ChatGPT to help grade and edit a rough draft of mine to make it better.


Week 3

I used ai to help me in another class based on SQL to fix a code I was getting errors with and trying to clean the code up. I inserted my code into it and asked for it to review my code and fix my errors and tell me how to make it mroe clear. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d9ebe4-ec84-8333-9dbd-cd2f8c9e7624


Week 4

I used ai for an assignment in my english class for a discussion showing the different responses from ai and human based responses. I gave the ai a prompt and a language for a way I wanted the ai to respond to the prompt then I had to compare it to my original response to the prompt and find the differences in human responses and ai responses. https://claude.ai/chat/fcb6dfc2-e512-4068-9329-4a187a7865b7

Week 5

This week I used ai to help create ideas for our group project, Function Library, and to help with assignents in another class. For the group poject I used ai to help create a rating system for the books we plan on adding into our data base. This allow for you pick a book and it would ask you to enter a number 1-5 to rate the book then save it. Some of the prompts I used was to ask how would I conceptually write a code that would add the rating system for the books in our database.  I did this because I was struggling to get the pop up question to import the 1-5 rating. From this I learned that ai can be extremly benefical when writing code and helping create ideas for how to code an idea that you have. I have made the decision to ask ai to help make the code for a entry level python coder so I can understand what it is doing but also to look out for tools that I dont know that I can use in the future. 

Week 7

This week I used ai to help troubleshoot some of the classes I was creating for the project 2 assignment. I also used it when making all of the classes that my group made and got help on how to make them integrated together to make them work well. I also used it in my english class to help with making infographics for an assignment.

Week 8

This week I used ai to help come up with ideas for a paper that I have to write in my english class. I also used it to create an outline to give me a headstart for what to research and write about when I get started writing the paper. I also used it to help normalize data for my sql class as I was struggling with specific parts of normalization.

Week 9 

This week I used ai for an assignment for a class dealing with SQL. The assignmnet asked us to use ai to see how it would answer our question on the first prompt then as we edited it and compare it to how we would write the query. I also used if for the same paper stated in last weeks to get a better outline and more ideas for stats to put into my paper.

Week 10

This week I used ai to help trouble shootwith both my project 3 code and a sql code I had to write for another class. I was able to ask claude different versions of the question to get multiple different outputs to make sure it was producing what I wanted it to produce.

Week 12

This week I used ai to help create a visual comparing two different ship sizes for an investigative report on the Francis Scott Key bridge collapse. https://gemini.google.com/app/f483cb06c7352163?is_sa=1&is_sa=1&android-min-version=301356232&ios-min-version=322.0&campaign_id=bkws&utm_source=sem&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=bkws&utm_campaign=2024enUS_gemfeb&pt=9008&mt=8&ct=p-growth-sem-bkws&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20108148196&gbraid=0AAAAApk5Bhnb5vb3NUhTa5oFjAzGitoJO&gclid=CjwKCAiAxc_JBhA2EiwAFVs7XE5oti74_DiJ7Tep3zV0PZbCQ4GEemEMAijpXMBqKjDT26bWmjkd4xoCSLQQAvD_BwE

Week 13

This week I used ai to adjust the visual i made last week to help make it look more important. I also used ai to help me troubleshoot code for the project 4 with the testing section.
